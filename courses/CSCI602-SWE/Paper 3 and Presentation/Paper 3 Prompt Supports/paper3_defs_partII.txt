Static Code Analysis(SCA):
Static code analysis (SCA) is the analysis of computer programs that is performed without actually executing the programs, usually by using an automated tool.

Open Research Challenges of Localizing Faults in Programs Using Constraints
Automated debugging, i.e., localizing faults in programs automatically using a failing test case and the source code, is still and open research topic despite the fact that there have been 
many different techniques already published. In this paper we focus on constraints 
for debugging. Constraints cannot only be effectively used for verification and testing, 
but also provide a foundation for automated fault localization. We briefly discuss the basic 
idea of constraint based debugging and outline some of the most important challenges.
